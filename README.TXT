PURPOSE OF PROJECT:
        This project allows the user to practice numbers in various languages.
    Numbers are ubiquitous in everyday language, but students may not have 
    opportunities to practice as much as needed in World Language classrooms. 
    Numbers in quantities and prices can be difficult for language learners, so this 
    app gives the aspiring speaker the opportunity to practice the numbers as 
    many times as they would like.

CHALLENGES
    Initially, I hoped to put together a single string from a random 1-3 digit number 
    using cascading if/else if statements. I found string manipulation to be 
    much more complicated than building an ArrayList first, then pulling an item 
    from that list. 
    The system resources used from many lists being compounded and re-compounded 
    may make older machines less responsive. 
    I only had one instance of a crash when I was trying to overwhelm my system's 
    resources.
